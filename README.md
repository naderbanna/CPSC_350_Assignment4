Known Errors
- currently has some functionality for a single window
- I was working on a more thorough implementation that would adhere to all of the assignment
requirements, but I was not able to to complete it and finish debugging (issue with assigning temporary address to struct variables). I left it all in the comments so that my work is still visible.
- Im not sure if we were allowed to use structs since we hadn't learned them before. My friend suggested I
try to use them so I did my research and implemented them for the window and student.
